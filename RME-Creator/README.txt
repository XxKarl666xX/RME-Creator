Put this whole folder onto your Desktop.
When trying to generate code the tool will look for "NameData.txt" and "UsedNameData.txt". Both these files MUST be inside a folder called "RME-Creator" on your Desktop!
This isnt a recommendation, this is a must. If the tool doesnt find these files on your desktop then you will only get a error.
If your out of names for some reason then either generate new names with the python script or delete the content of "UsedNameData.txt". You can also just write your own names inside "NameData.txt" to use your custom names.

Dont be a fucking retard, read this shit.
